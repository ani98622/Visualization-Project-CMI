# Visualization Project

Welcome to my Visualization Project as part of my curriculum at CMI. This project is centered around data analysis and visualization using the R programming language.

### Components of the Project:

1. **Component-I (EDA in R Markdown):**
   - Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a selected dataset.
   - All code and analysis are documented in R Markdown.
   - Final submission includes the knitted PDF from R Markdown.

2. **Component-II (Interactive Dashboard using R Shiny):**
   - Developed an interactive dashboard using R Shiny.
   - The dashboard provides insightful representations of the analyzed data.
   - Hosted the dashboard on a server for easy access.

3. **Component-III (Explanatory Video):**
   - Created a comprehensive explanatory video, approximately 5 minutes in length.
   - The video showcases the data analysis process, key insights, and visualizations derived.
