Hello visitor! This is a part of my curriculum in CMI. There we have to work on R programming language.
Work done was divided into 3 components viz.
<br>1 - *Component-I* : We have to select a data set and perform an EDA on the data and write up all the code in R <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; markdown.The final submission includes the knitted pdf from R markdown.
<br>2 - *Component-II* : We have to work on R shiny to make up a dashboard (interactive) to represent our work and deploy it on the server.
<br>3 - *Component-III* : To the last we have to make a explanatory video of the work done of nearly 5 minutes.
